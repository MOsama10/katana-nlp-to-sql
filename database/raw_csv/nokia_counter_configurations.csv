Reasons that trigger the counter: 
- Phantom RACHs that have a valid establishment cause. 
- The BTS can hear the MS, but the MS cannot hear the BTS, and so the MS does not respond to the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message with a SABM. 
- MS is accessing the network at the limit of sensitivity and messages are lost. 
- Poor Radio conditions. 
- MS is accessing network through another BTS (co-channel, co-BSIC interference).

NOTE! This RACH counter is triggered when the RX Level is above -100dBm. Other detection methods (like CRC or S/N) are not applied. This means that high load on RACH may occure even without a significant number of CHANNEL_REQUIRED messages.
